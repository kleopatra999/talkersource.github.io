title: What is a 'Talker'?
---

Talkers are a form of online virtual worlds in which multiple users are connected at
the same time to chat in real-time. People log in to the talkers remotely (usually
via telnet), and have a basic text interface with which to communicate with each other.
Most talkers are free and based on open-source software.

Dating back to the 1980s, they were a predecessor of instant messaging,
<abbr title="Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games">MMORPGs</abbr>, and
other virtual worlds such as _Second Life_.  The early talkers were similar to
<abbr title="Multi-User Dungeons (or Dimensions)">MUDs</abbr> with most of the complex
game machinery stripped away, leaving just the communication level commands â€” hence
the name "talker". <a href="/codebases/ewtoo.html"><i>EW-too</i></a> was, in fact, a
MUD server with the game elements removed.

Many of the online metaphors used on talkers, such as "rooms" and "residency", were
established by these early pioneering services and remain in use by modern replacements.
