Generally regarded as the _second_ talker to ever exist, after _Cat Chat_,
and the first to be written from scratch as a talker.  (_Cat Chat_ was a
stripped-down version of LPMud.) It was originally hosted at the University
of Warwick, on the UK's [JANET][JANET] (Joint Academic NETwork) and then
later globally when the university joined the Internet.

TalkerSource.com is happy to be able to serve this archive content and
help preserve a piece of Internet history.  Please note that the archive
contains source code, but the author witheld additional configuration and
data files to discourage recipients from running imitation copies of the
original talker.
