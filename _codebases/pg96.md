> First, what is this code called?
> 
> There are 4 names that are "sanctioned" for it. The official name of this
> talker release is "PlayGround 96" or PG96.  An older, and functionally
> equivalent name is "PlayCode 96" or PC96.  The distinction is that 
> PlayCode refers only to the source code, where PlayGround refers to the
> entire release.  In some documents, you'll here it refered to as PG, 
> in others as PC. The reason? I'm lazy. Deal. 
> 
> There are also approved "nicknames" for the code.  The main two are 
> EW4 (or spelled out, EW-for, or ElseWhere-for).  The name "deathtraP",
> a working name in the early going, should not be used, and is 
> discouraged, because it gives credit to one author over the other three,
> and it just sounds stupid anyway ;-P  
> 
> Bottom Line. The official name is PlayGround 96. PlayCode 96 refers to
> the code only (and not the auxillaries like Update 1.1 or MS 1.2, or the
> help files, etc).  EW4 is an approved shorthand (and denotes PG96's 
> origins, being based on EW2)
