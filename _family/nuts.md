## NUTS History (also written by Neil)

NUTS started out as a university project in 1992 for the final year of my
degree course and it was the 2nd best option in my opinion from writing a MUD
which the CS department decided "wasn't appropriate". So I came up with
some specious title for a talker project along the lines of a "multiuser
realtime networked conferencing system" or some such bullshit and they
fell for it :) Having seen a number of other systems such as the complex
EW-TOO by Simon Marsh (which to me seemed to be inhabiting some middle ground 
between mud and talker), the very simple such as the talker built into Unaxcess
(sp?) and the truly appalling (did someone say IRC?) I designed NUTS as being 
a system that anyone would be able to master straight away the minute they 
logged in. These days its somewhat more complex and probably sits alongside 
EW-TOO in the talker stakes but hopefully its still just as easy to use for 
first timers.

These are the dates on which various nuts version were release as best I can
remember or find out...
