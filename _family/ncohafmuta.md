title: Ncohafmuta
family: ncohafmuta
---

According to the [Talker Family Tree][tree], the Ncohafmuta codebase was derived from _Iforms_
which was a fork off of [NUTS 1.x][nuts1].  So from that perspective, one could argue that
Ncohafmuta belongs in the [NUTS family][nuts].  However, this site considers Ncohafmuta to be
its own family since it is one of only a few codebases -- if not the _only_ codebase -- actively
in-use at the beginning of the decline and still based off of _NUTS 1.x_.  Most other active
NUTS-derived codebases at the time had forked from 3.x, making Ncohafmuta a unique if not
original variant.
