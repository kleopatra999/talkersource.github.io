    <h2>What are/were <q>talkers</q>?</h2>
    <p>
      Talkers, as they were known, were text-based real-time chat servers that existed on the Internet
      during the <q>early days</q> of the public Internet.  This was a time when...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>instant messaging</em> (e.g. ICQ, AOL IM, etc.) did not exist</li>
      <li>the most common Internet access was through work or a university</li>
      <li>home users relied upon very slow <em>dial-up modems</em> that tied up a landline telephone circuit</li>
      <li>a TCP/IP stack (required for Internet communication) was not a standard part of Windows or Mac OS</li>
      <li><em>graphical</em> Web-browsing was a new invention; most Internet services were <em>text-based</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Individual talkers were often customized around a <em>theme</em>, and consisted of multiple named
      <q>rooms</q> that fit within the theme.  Some rooms were public, and others could be made private
      for sensitive conversations.  As the name suggests, the purpose was primarily to enable casual
      conversation.  (Unlike MUDs, which were similar software services of the era, but these often focused
      more on role- or game-play than conversation.)  Since all communication was text-based, it was relatively
      quick (as long as your connection didn't experience <em>lag</em>) but mostly required users to be
      online simultaneously, in stark contrast to other Internet communication formats such as e-mail or Usenet.
      Customizations and distinguishing features, made to attract users to a particular talker server over another,
      were almost always applied by changing the source code and recompiling.  Popular code bases were shared
      and <a href="talkertree.txt" title="Talker family tree">forked, renamed, and shared</a> again.
    </p><p>
      IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is another text-based, real-time chat technology from the same era and its user
      experience exists essentially unchanged on the Internet of today.  IRC networks facilitate chat, messaging,
      and even file transfers, but lack the theming that gave each Talker site a unique personality.
    </p>
    <h2>The Decline</h2>
    <p>
      Talkers rapidly declined in both popularity and in the number of operating sites since the late 1990s.
      When <em>talker.com</em>, a site dedicated specifically to hosting Talker servers, closed in the late
      2000s, the mere existence of Talkers was threatened more than ever.  Understandably, as the talker
      instances disappear so does their customized source code.  By 2010, nearly all of the original distribution
      sources for the most popular Talker code bases (forks) had disappeared, lost to <q>the great bit bucket
      in the sky</q>.
    </p>
    <h2>The TalkerSource.com goal</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to maintain an archive of as many Talker and MUD code bases as we can find, to preserve a
      piece of the Internet social communities that started it all, before instant messaging and social media
      took over.  While we can archive the source code, we cannot recover the friendships that were lost as
      servers went offline, one by one.
